# Financial Performance Analysis â€“ Tableau Project

**Project Objective:** The goal of this Tableau project was to analyze financial performance across different countries, products, and time periods using key financial metrics such as sales, profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and discounts. The project aims to provide a comprehensive view of business performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions that optimize profitability and operational efficiency.

# Key Insights and Features:

**Gross Sales vs. Discounts Analysis:**
A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between gross sales and discounts for various products and regions. This analysis allows decision-makers to evaluate whether discount strategies effectively boost sales or if adjustments are needed.

**Sales & Profit Trends Over Time:**
An interactive timeline showcases sales and profit trends categorized by customer segments (e.g., Government, Small Business, Enterprise, etc.), providing valuable insights into which segments are driving growth and which may require further attention.

**Sales by Product & Discount Band:**
A heat map compares product performance across different discount bands (High, Medium, Low, and None), enabling quick assessment of how discounts impact sales across products, and which pricing strategies lead to higher revenue.

**Sales vs. Profit by Country:**
This bar chart presents a country-by-country comparison of sales versus profit, helping stakeholders assess geographical performance. The visualization enables an easy understanding of where the most profitable markets are and where adjustments may be needed.

# Tools & Techniques Used:

**Tableau**: Utilized to create dynamic and interactive dashboards with advanced visualization techniques such as scatter plots, heat maps, and bar charts to convey key financial data and insights.

**Pivot Tables and VLOOKUPs**: These Excel functions were used to preprocess and structure the raw data, ensuring data accuracy and consistency before visualizing in Tableau.
Data Management: Organized data from multiple sources to ensure consistency in reporting, such as aligning sales, COGS, discounts, and profit data for each analysis.

# Business Impact:

**Improved Decision-Making**: This dashboard empowers business leaders to make informed decisions by identifying high-performing products and markets, optimizing discount strategies, and tracking performance across different time periods.

**Revenue Optimization**: By highlighting the relationship between discounts and sales, this analysis provides actionable insights into how pricing adjustments can drive revenue growth.

**Geographical and Product Analysis**: The ability to segment performance data by country and product enables the business to better understand market trends and allocate resources accordingly.
